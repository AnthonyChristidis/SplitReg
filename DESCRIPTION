Description: Functions for computing split regularized estimators estimators defined in Christidis, Lakshmanan, Smucler and Zamar (2019)
             <arXiv:1712.03561>. The procedure works on top of a given penalized linear regression estimator,
             the Elastic Net in this implementation, by fitting it to possibly overlapping subsets of features, while at the same
             time encouraging diversity among the subsets, to reduce the correlations between the predictions
             that result from each fitted model. The predictions from the models are then aggregated.
